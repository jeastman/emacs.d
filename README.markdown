Emacs Configuration
###################

This is the latest version of my Emacs configuration. It is in a non-literate (illiterate) format. While literate code seems like a great idea (especially for a configuration file) and seems like it would lead to a wonderful experience, it has not for me. I find that as I hack on my configuration, the added literate verbiage seems contrived and redundant. Most of the time, the code speaks for iteself and the addition of the literate text is unnecessary/ While this may not be true for some of the larger components, most of the time the code itself is sufficient. When it is not, code comments fill in the gaps.

This configuration is overly opinionated and very subjective. It is meant to support my own workflow without regard to more generic usage. I continue to post my configuration with the idea that parts of it may be useful to others.

I've strived to prioritize the built-in Emacs functionality whenever possible. Previous iterations of my configuration did not do this. Emacs built-in functionality has evolved to a point where I believe my needs are able to be met.

If you are interested in a more reusable configuration, I would suggest one of the many other configurations available with similar ideals. Some examples are:

- Protesilaos Stavrou's [[literate configruation][https://protesilaos.com/emacs/dotemacs]]
- David Wilson's [[rational-emacs][https://github.com/SystemCrafters/rational-emacs]]

Please understand that this configuration is what I use and may not work for you. While I do not hope or intend for it to be the case, using parts of this configuration may break your own configuration. I use the same configuration from multiple machines, therefore it is likely to work "out-of-the-box" in different environments.
