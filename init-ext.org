* Reworking Configuration

  I recently read a [[http://www.lunaryorn.com/2015/01/06/my-emacs-configuration-with-use-package.html][post]] by Sebastian Wiesner regarding the use of
  =use-package= that got me curious enough to attempt to rework my Emacs
  configuration. I now attempt to utilize =use-package= for all of the
  packages I use. Check John Wiegley's [[https://github.com/jwiegley/use-package/][Github Page]] for more details.

  I previously used =Cask= and =Pallet= to manage all of my packages, which
  worked quite well, but did not address the configuration side of
  things. Moving forward, I am likely to use a combination of the two.

    :ensure t
    :pin marmalade)

#+END_SRC

* General Configuration
** Exec path

   Ensure that =/usr/local/bin= is in the exec path.

   #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
   (when (not (member "/usr/local/bin" exec-path))
     (add-to-list 'exec-path "/usr/local/bin"))
   #+END_SRC

** Library Paths

Everything is situated underneath =user-emacs-directory (~/.emacs.d)=

This makes everything self-contained and easy to migrate to other
environments.

This section contains all of the path configurations that are not machine
specific. A seperate directory =(~/.emacs-meta)= is configured for =Meta=
information files (backups, temporary files, etc.)

*** Metafiles

First, we need to define the  =metafiles-dir= values.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(defvar metafiles-dir
  "~/.emacs-meta" "Custom location for metadata.")
#+END_SRC

As this may be the first time I am running in this environment, the
=metafiles-dir= directory may not actually exist. We go ahead and create
it if it doesn't.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(unless (file-exists-p metafiles-dir)
  (make-directory metafiles-dir))
#+END_SRC

*** Temporary directory

I can now set the Emacs temporary directory to be within the
=metafiles-dir=, again creating it if necessary.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(setq temporary-file-directory (concat metafiles-dir "/tmp/"))
(unless (file-exists-p temporary-file-directory)
  (make-directory temporary-file-directory))
#+END_SRC

** Package Management

I have moved /almost/ everything to use the package management system
instead of referencing external projects directly. This is extremely
convenient and makes updates very simple.

My Emacs packages are now managed by [[https://github.com/cask/cask][Cask]] and [[https://github.com/rdallasgray/pallet][Pallet]], along with =use-package=.

I maintain a list of the packages I am using here, but the actual list of
pacakges is managed in the =Cask= file. Pallet helps to ensure that the
packages installed are kept in sync with the dependency spec.

*** Packages

This list is a /mostly/ up-to-date list of the packages I use. Refer to the
=Cask= file for the list of packages actually installed.

My friend [[https://github.com/gordyt][Gordon]] put together the following script to generate a list of
the packages installed, which means the list is more up-to-date than it
used to be.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :tangle no
  (defun jme/gen-package-table ()
    "Generate a table of all installed packages, along with their descriptions"
    (cons '("_Package Name_" "_Package Description_")
    (sort
     (mapcar
      (lambda (pkg-desc)
        (list (car pkg-desc) (package-desc-summary (cadr pkg-desc))))
      package-alist)
     `(lambda (a b) (string-lessp (car a) (car b))))))

  (jme/gen-package-table)

** Additional Paths

I add the =user-emacs-directory= to the load path here to ensure we can pick up
the additional configuration files.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(add-to-list 'load-path (concat user-emacs-directory "/lisp"))
#+END_SRC

I also add all top-level subdirectories of =user-emacs-directory=.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(let ((default-directory user-emacs-directory))
      (normal-top-level-add-subdirs-to-load-path))
#+END_SRC

*** Paths for meta-information

I set up variables for all paths needed for storing things in the
=meta-information= directory. By consolidating them all in one place (and
using the variables later), I have an easier time keeping track of them
and maintaining them.

| Variable         | Purpose                                                                                                   |
|------------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| =meta-saveplace= | Name of the file that records the =save-place-alist=, which stores the location of point in visited files |
| =meta-backup=    | Location for backup files                                                                                 |
| =meta-bookmarks= | Bookmarks file.                                                                                           |
| =meta-savehist=  | File used by =savehist= where minibuffer history is saved to and loaded                                   |
| =meta-recent=    | File to save the recent list into                                                                         |
| =meta-saves=     | Prefix to use for auto-save files                                                                         |
| =meta-ido=       | File in which the =ido= state is saved between invocations                                                |
| =meta-tramp=     | File used for =tramp= persistence                                                                         |

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(defvar meta-saveplace (concat metafiles-dir "/saveplace")
  "Name of the file that records save-place-alist.")
(defvar meta-bookmarks (concat metafiles-dir "/bookmarks")
  "Location for bookmarks file.")
(defvar meta-savehist (concat metafiles-dir "/savehist")
  "File used by savehist where minibuffer history is saved to and loaded.")
(defvar meta-recent (concat metafiles-dir "/recentf")
  "File to save the recent list into.")
(defvar meta-saves (concat metafiles-dir "/auto-save-list/.saves-")
  "Prefix to use for auto-save files.")
(defvar meta-ido (concat metafiles-dir "/ido.last")
  "File in which the ido state is saved between invocations.")
(defvar meta-tramp (concat metafiles-dir "/tramp")
  "File used for tramp persistence.")
(defvar meta-url (concat metafiles-dir "/url")
  "Directory for url files.")
#+END_SRC

*** Non-packaged packages

I used to use several packages that did not exist in package archives. In
order to handle loading these, I added the 3rd party libraries in the
=vendor= directory. I no longer do this, but have kept the logic for
reference, though it is no longer tangled to the generated file.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :tangle no
(defvar vendor-dir (concat user-emacs-directory "vendor")
  "3rd party library directory for items not managed by Cask.")
(unless (file-exists-p vendor-dir)
  (make-directory vendor-dir))
(add-to-list 'load-path vendor-dir)
(let ((default-directory vendor-dir))
     (normal-top-level-add-subdirs-to-load-path))
#+END_SRC

I leverage the =bind-key= package to do all of my key-binding. I need
to =require= it in early to handle all of my mode-specific key
bindings. Not sure this is technically required to be loaded anymore since
it is a dependancy of =use-package=, but it doesn't hurt.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(use-package bind-key
  :ensure t)
#+END_SRC

*** System and user specific configuration

I run the same configuration on several machines. Different machines have
different capabilities as well as different file system layouts. To handle
this situation, I load system specific files based on the name of the
machine. I also load in a file based on user name, to handle additional
environments.

My previous implementation for handling this had become too complicated and
had some trouble with ordering. So, I have simplified things by having
several functions.

**** Custom Settings

   Keep emacs Custom-settings in separate file. I previously converted most
   of my variable assignmets to setting custom variables during
   init. Therefore, the contents of the =custom.el= file is mostly
   populated from configuration.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(setq custom-file (expand-file-name "custom.el" user-emacs-directory))
#+END_SRC

**** Basic loading function
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(defun jme/load (directory base)
  "Look for files located in DIRECTORY whose base name is BASE.

Check the base name against several extensions.  If a file with 
that name exists, then load it."
  (let ((literate      (expand-file-name (concat base ".org") directory))
        (encrypted-org (expand-file-name (concat base ".org.gpg") directory))
        (plain         (expand-file-name (concat base ".el") directory))
        (encrypted-el  (expand-file-name (concat base ".el.gpg") directory)))
   (cond
    ((file-exists-p encrypted-org) (org-babel-load-file encrypted-org))
    ((file-exists-p encrypted-el)  (load encrypted-el))
    ((file-exists-p literate)      (org-babel-load-file literate))
    ((file-exists-p plain)         (load plain)))))
#+END_SRC

**** Private settings

     Personal information that should not be shared is kept in a private
     file.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(jme/load user-emacs-directory ".private")
#+END_SRC

**** OS-specific settings

     Settings specific to machine type are kept in their own settings file.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(let* ((system-name (symbol-name system-type))
       (base-name (replace-regexp-in-string "/" "-" system-name)))
  (jme/load user-emacs-directory base-name))
#+END_SRC

**** Hostname-specific settings

     Settings specific to a particular machine, identified by host name,
     are stored in their own settings file.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(let ((host-name-base (car (split-string (system-name) "\\."))))
  (jme/load user-emacs-directory host-name-base))
#+END_SRC

**** User-specific settings

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(jme/load user-emacs-directory user-login-name)
#+END_SRC

**** Custom configuration

   Finally, we load any settings set by ~customize~.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(load custom-file)
#+END_SRC

** General Emacs Settings

There are a number of configuration items I tend to look at as basic
configuration. There is a fine line between what is a /package/ and what
is just part of Emacs, especially at the rate things are being included in
the /official/ distribution.

*** Window sizing

When using a =window-system=, which I most often do, I like to start Emacs
with a specific window size and position. This code accomplishes that.

First, we need to set up the window sizing.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(eval-when-compile
  (defvar emacs-min-top)
  (defvar emacs-min-left)
  (defvar emacs-min-height)
  (defvar emacs-min-width))

(if window-system
    (unless noninteractive
      (defvar emacs-min-top 22)
      (defvar emacs-min-left 5)
      (defvar emacs-min-height (if (= 1050 (x-display-pixel-height)) 55 64))
      (defvar emacs-min-width 100)))
#+END_SRC

This function resets the window to its minimal position.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(defun jme/emacs-min ()
"Reset frame size to minumum."
  (interactive)
  (set-frame-parameter (selected-frame) 'fullscreen nil)
  (set-frame-parameter (selected-frame) 'vertical-scroll-bars nil)
  (set-frame-parameter (selected-frame) 'horizontal-scroll-bars nil)
  (set-frame-parameter (selected-frame) 'top emacs-min-top)
  (set-frame-parameter (selected-frame) 'left emacs-min-left)
  (set-frame-parameter (selected-frame) 'height emacs-min-height)
  (set-frame-parameter (selected-frame) 'width emacs-min-width))
#+END_SRC

This function does the opposite of the above. It sets the window to
maximum position.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(defun jme/emacs-max ()
"Reset frame size to maximum."
  (interactive)
  (if t
      (progn
        (set-frame-parameter (selected-frame) 'fullscreen 'fullboth)
        (set-frame-parameter (selected-frame) 'vertical-scroll-bars nil)
        (set-frame-parameter (selected-frame) 'horizontal-scroll-bars nil))
    (set-frame-parameter (selected-frame) 'top 26)
    (set-frame-parameter (selected-frame) 'left 2)
    (set-frame-parameter (selected-frame) 'width
                         (floor (/ (float (x-display-pixel-width)) 9.15)))
    (if (= 1050 (x-display-pixel-height))
        (set-frame-parameter (selected-frame) 'height
                             (if (>= emacs-major-version 24)
                                 66
                               55))
      (set-frame-parameter (selected-frame) 'height
                           (if (>= emacs-major-version 24)
                               75
                             64)))))
#+END_SRC

One last function to give me the ability to toggle between the two.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(defun jme/emacs-toggle-size ()
"Toggle between minimum and maximum size of frame."
  (interactive)
  (if (> (cdr (assq 'width (frame-parameters))) 100)
      (jme/emacs-min)
    (jme/emacs-max)))
#+END_SRC

I start off with Emacs in its minimal state when starting up. Since moving
to the =mac= Emacs port on my Apple machines, as opposed to the =ns=
version, I don't really use the toggle much anymore. Instead I use the mac
fullscreen mode.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(if window-system
    (add-hook 'after-init-hook 'jme/emacs-min))
#+END_SRC

*** Coding system

I am a fan of UTF-8. Make sure everything is set up to handle it.

| Variable                     | Value   | Description          |
|------------------------------+---------+----------------------|
| =set-terminal-coding-system= | =utf-8= | terminal output      |
| =set-terminal-coding-system= | =utf-8= | terminal input       |
| =perfer-coding-system=       | =utf-8= | set preferred coding |

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(set-terminal-coding-system 'utf-8)
(set-keyboard-coding-system 'utf-8)
(prefer-coding-system 'utf-8)
#+END_SRC

*** Interface settings

I most often have the audio on my machines muted, so use the visible bell
instead of beeps. Who likes beeps anyway?

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(setq visible-bell t)
#+END_SRC

Make sure I can see what it is that I am typing. This setting is the
number of seconds to pause before unfinished commands are echoed. I find
the default of 1 second a bit slow.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(setq echo-keystrokes 0.1)
#+END_SRC

I am not a big fan of overloading the arrow keys. Plus they are just too
far away from my fingers to be useful. Don't use the shift+arrows for mark.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(setq shift-select-mode nil)
#+END_SRC

Use point instead of click with mouse yank.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(setq mouse-yank-at-point t)
#+END_SRC

While I no longer have a machine with a mouse connected (only trackpads
now), I still use swipe-type scrolling which I would like to be smooth.

These settings handle one line at a time, disable scrolling acceleration
and scroll the window under the mouse.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(setq scroll-step 1)
(setq mouse-wheel-scroll-amount '(1 ((shift) . 1))) ; one line at a time
(setq mouse-wheel-progressive-speed nil) ; don't accelerate scrolling
(setq mouse-wheel-follow-mouse 't) ; scroll window under mouse
#+END_SRC

Truncate lines in windows narrower than the frame.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(setq truncate-partial-width-windows t)
#+END_SRC

Set the default tab stop.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(setq-default tab-width 4)
#+END_SRC

Never put tabs in files, use spaces instead. If, for some reason, a real
tab is needed, use =C-q C-i= to insert one.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(setq-default indent-tabs-mode nil)
#+END_SRC

I want to always go to the next indent level when hitting return.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(bind-key "RET" 'newline-and-indent)
#+END_SRC

Add newlines to the end of the file if I naviagate past it.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(setq next-line-add-newlines t)
#+END_SRC

Set the column that triggers fill

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(setq-default fill-column 75)
#+END_SRC

Turn on auto fill for text files.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(add-hook 'text-mode-hook 'turn-on-auto-fill)
#+END_SRC

Allow narrowing.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(put 'narrow-to-defun 'disabled nil)
(put 'narrow-to-page 'disabled nil)
(put 'narrow-to-region 'disabled nil)
#+END_SRC

*** Visual tweaks

Unlike a number of people, I do not mind the menu bar if I am actually
using a window system of some kind. It is not that I use it often, but it
does not get in my way much either. So, I check to see if I am using a
window system and disable it if not. Turns out that this is still annoying
when the window system does not support global menus as is the case when I
am running on my chromebook with i3wm. Still need a solution for that case.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(if (eq window-system 'nil)
    (if (fboundp 'menu-bar-mode) (menu-bar-mode -1))
  (if (fboundp 'menu-bar-mode) (menu-bar-mode 1)))
#+END_SRC

The toolbar, however, is completely useless to me, so I always disable it.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(if (fboundp 'tool-bar-mode) (tool-bar-mode -1))
#+END_SRC

Likewise, scrollbars offer no value.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(if (fboundp 'scroll-bar-mode) (scroll-bar-mode -1))
#+END_SRC

Don't show the startup message.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(setq inhibit-startup-message t
      inhibit-startup-echo-area-message t)
#+END_SRC

Visually indicate empty lines after the buffer end. This is shown as a
fringe bitmap in the left edge.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(set-default 'indicate-empty-lines t)
#+END_SRC

Cause Emacs to fully redraw the display before it processes queued input
events. Apparently this provides a slight performance tweak for newer
machines. My machines seem to be able to handle it. Picked up from
[[http://www.masteringemacs.org/articles/2011/10/02/improving-performance-emacs-display-engine/][here]].

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(setq redisplay-dont-pause t)
#+END_SRC

**** Modeline

I refer to my modeline quite often. It is very easy for it to get too
cluttered, it is expensive real estate.

Show the line:column number.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(line-number-mode 1)
(column-number-mode 1)
#+END_SRC

Also, show the size of the file.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(size-indication-mode 1)
#+END_SRC

***** Battery information

Battery information display in the modeline is controlled by
=battery-mode-line-format= and =battery-status-function=. I enable this
whenever I am on a mac, +as I only have mac laptops+ (now running on a
chromebook also).

=battery-mode-line-format= is a customizable variable, I am setting it here
to reflect the following format:

  - "⚡︎ "
  - status
    - =empty= - high
    - =-= - low
    - =!= - critical
    - =+= - charging
  - load percentage
  - =%=
  - " " - a space
  - time remaining

The result should look something like:

=⚡︎ 42% 2:30=

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (if (string-equal system-type "darwin")
      (custom-set-variables
        '(battery-mode-line-format "⚡️%b%p%% %t "))
    (custom-set-variables
      '(battery-mode-line-format "⚡︎ %b%p%%%% %t ")))
  (display-battery-mode)
#+END_SRC

***** Time

I often run emacs in a fullscreen fashion that does not display the system
clock on my desktop. However, I often refer to the clock, thus I add it to
the modeline. The =display-time= functionality in Emacs is quite robust and
can potentially display much more information than just the time. I
configure it here to my liking.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (setq display-time-default-load-average nil)  ; Don't display load
  (setq display-time-day-and-date nil)  ; Don't display date
  (if (string-equal system-type "darwin")
      (custom-set-variables
        '(display-time-format "🕗%l:%M%p"))
    (custom-set-variables
      '(display-time-format "%l:%M%p")))
  (display-time-mode)
#+END_SRC

*** Miscellaneous

Add newline to end of file on save.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(setq require-final-newline t)
#+END_SRC

Make Emacs use the clipboard

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(setq x-select-enable-clipboard t)

#+END_SRC

Prefix used for generating the auto save file names.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(setq auto-save-list-file-prefix meta-saves)
#+END_SRC

**** Bookmarks

Save bookmarks into their own file in the meta information directory.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(custom-set-variables '(bookmark-default-file meta-bookmarks))
#+END_SRC

**** Backup

I like all of my backup copies of files to be in a common location.

Configure where the backups should go.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(setq backup-directory-alist (quote ((".*" . "~/.emacs-meta/backups/"))))
#+END_SRC

I like to use version numbers for the backup files. Set the number of
newest versions and oldest versions to keep when a new numbered backup is
made. I also don't care about the deletion of excess backup versions, so do
that silently. Also, I like to use copying to create backups for files
that are linked, instead of renaming.

| Variable                        | Value | Description                                                          |
|---------------------------------+-------+----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| =version-control=               | =t=   | Control use of version numbers for backup files                      |
| =kept-new-versions=             | =2=   | Number of newest versions to keep when a new numbered backup is made |
| =kept-old-versions=             | =2=   | Number of oldest versions to keep when a new numbered backup is made |
| =delete-old-versions=           | =t=   | When set to =t=, delete excess backup versions silently              |
| =backup-by-copying-when-linked= | =t=   | Use copying to create backups for files with multiple names          |

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp

**** URL Related

     Make sure to store URL related stuff in the right place.

     #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
     (setq url-cookie-file (concat meta-url "/cookies"))
     (setq url-cache-directory (concat temporary-file-directory "url/cache"))
     #+END_SRC

*** Global mode settings

**** Auto-revert

Revert buffers when they change on disk.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(global-auto-revert-mode 1)
#+END_SRC

Auto-refresh dired buffers.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(custom-set-variables '(global-auto-revert-non-file-buffers t))
#+END_SRC

But.. don't announce reversion of buffer

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(custom-set-variables '(auto-revert-verbose nil))
#+END_SRC

**** Git gutter

Git gutter is a nice little utility that adds markers in the fringe to
denote changes in a file. I like this everywhere, so I turn it on globally.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(use-package git-gutter-fringe
  :ensure t
  :diminish git-gutter-mode
  :init
  (progn
    (setq git-gutter:lighter " GG")
    (global-git-gutter-mode)))
#+END_SRC

**** Git messenger

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(use-package git-messenger
  :commands git-messenger:popup-message
  :bind ("C-x v p" . git-messenger:popup-message))
#+END_SRC

**** Recentf

Save recently used files. This turns on the "Open Recent" submenu which is
displayed in the "File" menu, containing a list of files that were
operated on recently.

I use the following settings for this mode:

| variable                 | value         | description                       |
|--------------------------+---------------+-----------------------------------|
| =recentf-save-file=      | =meta-recent= | File to save the recent list into |
| =recent-max-saved-items= | 100           | Max number of items saved         |
| =recent-max-menu-items=  | 15            | Max number of items in menu       |

Since the loading of the recent file and cleanup can take some time, I
turn it on once things are idle.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(use-package recentf
  :idle
  (progn
    (setq
      recentf-save-file meta-recent
      recentf-max-saved-items 100
      recentf-max-menu-items 15)
    (recentf-mode t)))
#+END_SRC

**** Savehist

Save minibuffer history. The minibuffer history is saved periodically
(every 300 seconds, in this case) and when exiting Emacs. I use
=savehist-file= to specify the filename (in the meta information directory)
where the history should be stored. Additionally, I have it set to save:

| History type         | Description                                        |
|----------------------+----------------------------------------------------|
| =search-ring=        | List of search string sequences                    |
| =regexp-search-ring= | List of regular expression search string sequences |

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(use-package savehist
  :init 
  (progn
    (setq savehist-additional-variables
      '(search-ring regexp-search-ring)
      savehist-autosave-interval 300
      savehist-file meta-savehist)
    (savehist-mode t)))
#+END_SRC

**** Saveplace

Preserve the location of point in file when saving files.

I specify the name of the file that records saveplace information, so the
contents go into the =meta= area and activate it for all buffers.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(use-package saveplace
  :pre-load
  (progn
    (setq save-place-file meta-saveplace)
    (setq-default save-place t)))
#+END_SRC

**** Show Paren mode

I like to visually see the matching parens. =Show Paren= mode is a global
minor mode that highlights matching parens. I have now replaced the
original =show paren= with =smartparens=.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(use-package smartparens
  :diminish smartparens-mode
  :ensure t
  :config
  (progn 
         (use-package smartparens-config)
         ;(smartparens-global-mode) ;; commented out until bug? fixed
         (show-smartparens-global-mode)))
#+END_SRC

**** Undo-tree-mode

=Undo-tree-mode= replaces Emacs' standard undo feature with a more
powerful, yet easier to user version, that treats the undo history as what
it is: a tree.

Enable =Undo-tree-mode= globally.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(use-package undo-tree
  :diminish undo-tree-mode
  :init (global-undo-tree-mode))
#+END_SRC

**** Whitespace

I like to see whitespace in files. I find this helps with both
organization and formatting. I use the following style for whitespace
visualization:

| Style            | Description                           |
|------------------+---------------------------------------|
| face             | enable all visualization via faces    |
| trailing         | trailing blanks                       |
| space-before-tab | SPACEs before TAB                     |
| space-after-tab  | 8 or more SPACEs after a TAB          |
| indentation      | 8 or more SPACEs at beginning of line |

I also specify the column beyond which the line is highlighted.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(use-package whitespace
  :diminish global-whitespace-mode
  :init
  (progn
    (setq whitespace-style '(face trailing space-before-tab
                       indentation space-after-tab)
          whitespace-line-column 80)
    (global-whitespace-mode 1)))

#+END_SRC

**** Winner

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(use-package winner
  :init (winner-mode 1))
#+END_SRC

* Utility functions

There are a number of /utility/ functions that I keep around for handling
different things. Some of them are experimental, but they /do/ work.

** Hide or Expand

I have kept this around for a long time and go through different phases
of using it. I have recently gone back to using it quite a bit now that I
have been using =winner= mode.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(defun hide-or-expand ()
  "Hide or expand a window."
  (interactive)
  (if (> (length (window-list)) 1)
      (delete-other-windows)
    (bury-buffer)))
#+END_SRC

** Mark and Pop

This bit of elisp allows optionally storing the mark before moving. I
adopted this from a [[https://gist.github.com/magnars/2350388][gist]] by Magnar Sveen.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(defvar push-mark-before-goto-char nil)
#+END_SRC

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(defadvice goto-char (before push-mark-first activate)
  (when push-mark-before-goto-char
    (push mark)))
#+END_SRC

* Package Specific Settings
** Ace-jump-mode

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(use-package ace-jump-mode
  :ensure t
  :bind ("C-. C-s" . ace-jump-mode))
#+END_SRC

** Auto complete

I have fiddled around with different auto-completion packages and
extensions over time. This one works.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(use-package auto-complete
  :diminish auto-complete-mode
  :demand t
  :ensure t
  :init
  (progn
    (setq ac-dictionary-files (concat metafiles-dir "/.dict"))
    (setq ac-comphist-file (concat metafiles-dir "/ac-comphist.dat")))
  :config
  (progn
    (ac-config-default)
    (bind-key "S-TAB" 'auto-complete ac-mode-map)))
#+END_SRC

** YASnippet

YASnippet is an excellent template system for Emacs and it works very well
with Auto Complete. I use it everywhere I can.

YASnippet does not provide a way to expand a snippet programmatically, so
we create one. (Based on code from [[http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10211730/insert-yasnippet-by-name][this]] Stack Overflow question.)

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(use-package yasnippet
  :idle (yas-global-mode 1)
  :diminish yas-minor-mode
  :ensure t
  :config
  (defun jme/insert-yas-by-name (name)
    (cl-flet ((dummy-prompt
            (prompt choices &optional display-fn)
            (declare (ignore prompt))
            (or (find name choices :key display-fn :test #'string=)
                (throw 'notfound nil))))
      (let ((yas/prompt-functions '(dummy-prompt)))
        (catch 'notfound
          (yas/insert-snippet t))))))

    :config
    (bind-key "M-r" 'coffee-compile-buffer coffee-mode-map))
#+END_SRC

** Deft

I find Deft to be a great note-taking utility.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(use-package deft
  :commands deft
  :ensure t
  :init
  (progn
    (setq
      deft-extension "org"
      deft-text-mode 'org-mode)
    (when (boundp 'my-notes)
      (setq deft-directory my-notes)))
  :bind ("<f9>" . deft))
#+END_SRC

** Dired

I have been trying to train myself to use =dired= as much as possible. My
go-to alternative is the command line, which often interrupts whatever I
was doing in the particular shell I choose. My settings here are still
very much experimental.

I moved to using =dired+= to pick up some extra features.

Make sure =image-dired= keeps its files in the meta directory.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
;; diredp-toggle-find-file-reuse-dir 1
  (use-package dired+
    :config
    (progn

     :ensure t)
   #+END_SRC

** Flyspell

I often use =flyspell= mode when writing text documents. I typically turn
this on a some point after I have already begun writing. This bit of
advice ensures that the buffer is checked when I turn =flyspell= on.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp

** Haskell

Make sure to ignore compiled Haskell files in filename completions.  Since
I like automatic indentation, it needs to be turned on for Haskell.  Also,
make sure to show documentation.

** Ido

Provide an easy way to load a recent file utilizing ido.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp

    (interactive)
    (let ((file (ido-completing-read "Choose recent file: " recentf-list nil t)))

Configure ido to use vertical mode. Much easier to see matches.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp

** Uniquify

By default, Emacs makes buffer names unique by adding =<2>=, =<3>=,
etc. to the end of the buffer name. I don't find this particularly
useful. Using the =Uniquify= package, I can easily change this behavior.

Use the =post-forward= type of naming for buffers. This names the buffer
with the file name followed by a shortened form of the path.

For example:

=/foo/bar/mumble/name= becomes =name|bar/mumble=

I change the string used as a separator for the buffer name components to
be ":".

Also, make sure to rerationalize buffer names after a buffer has been killed.

Some buffers should not be uniquified. I also provide a regular expression here
for these exceptions.


#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(use-package uniquify
  :init
  (setq
    uniquify-buffer-name-style 'post-forward

* Custom Configuration

** Window handling

*** Rotating Windows

I often have my frame split into multiple windows. I find it very handy to
swap buffers between windows if I am working in multiple buffers at the
same time. I came across this function to rotate buffers through windows
(you can find it [[http://whattheemacsd.com/buffer-defuns.el-02.html][here]].)

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (defun jme/rotate-windows ()
    "Rotate your windows."
    (interactive)
    (cond ((not (> (count-windows)1))
           (message "You can't rotate a single window!"))
          (t
           (let ((i 1)
                 (numWindows (count-windows)))
           (while  (< i numWindows)
             (let* (
                    (w1 (elt (window-list) i))
                    (w2 (elt (window-list) (+ (% i numWindows) 1)))
                    (b1 (window-buffer w1))
                    (b2 (window-buffer w2))
                    (s1 (window-start w1))
                    (s2 (window-start w2))
                    )
               (set-window-buffer w1  b2)
               (set-window-buffer w2 b1)
               (set-window-start w1 s2)
               (set-window-start w2 s1)
               (setq i (1+ i))))))))
#+END_SRC

*** Window Split

This function toggles between horizontal and vertical layout of two
windows. (Picked up from [[http://whattheemacsd.com/buffer-defuns.el-03.html][here]].)

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(defun jme/toggle-window-split ()
 "Toggle between horizontal and vertical layout of windows."
  (interactive)
  (if (= (count-windows) 2)
      (let* ((this-win-buffer (window-buffer))
             (next-win-buffer (window-buffer (next-window)))
             (this-win-edges (window-edges (selected-window)))
             (next-win-edges (window-edges (next-window)))
             (this-win-2nd (not (and (<= (car this-win-edges)
                                         (car next-win-edges))
                                     (<= (cadr this-win-edges)
                                         (cadr next-win-edges)))))
             (splitter
              (if (= (car this-win-edges)
                     (car (window-edges (next-window))))
                  'split-window-horizontally
                'split-window-vertically)))
        (delete-other-windows)
        (let ((first-win (selected-window)))
          (funcall splitter)
          (if this-win-2nd (other-window 1))
          (set-window-buffer (selected-window) this-win-buffer)
          (set-window-buffer (next-window) next-win-buffer)
          (select-window first-win)
          (if this-win-2nd (other-window 1))))))
#+END_SRC

** Cleanup

Whitespace cleanup can be dangerous if it changes the content of the
file. Some changes are guaranteed to be safe, which this function sticks
to, allowing it to be safe for a =before-save-hook=. (see
[[http://whattheemacsd.com/buffer-defuns.el-01.html][this article]].)

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(defun jme/cleanup-buffer-safe ()
  "Perform a bunch of safe operations on the whitespace content of a buffer.
Does not indent buffer, because it is used for a `before-save-hook', and that
might be bad."
  (interactive)
  (untabify (point-min) (point-max))
  (delete-trailing-whitespace)
  (set-buffer-file-coding-system 'utf-8))
#+END_SRC

If we want to be less careful when cleaning up, we can do that too.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(defun jme/cleanup-buffer ()
  "Perform a bunch of operations on the whitespace content of a buffer.
Including indent-buffer, which should not be called automatically on save."
  (interactive)
  (jme/cleanup-buffer-safe)
  (indent-region (point-min) (point-max)))
#+END_SRC

** Movement

*** Better handling of move to beginning of line

I find it useful to move to the beginning of the indentation as opposed to
strickly the beginning of the line. This accomplishes that in a smart
way. (See
[[http://emacsredux.com/blog/2013/05/22/smarter-navigation-to-the-beginning-of-a-line/][this article]].)

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (defun jme/smarter-move-beginning-of-line (arg)
    "Move point back to indentation of beginning of line.

  Move point to the first non-whitespace character on this line.
  If point is already there, move to the beginning of the line.
  Effectively toggle between the first non-whitespace character and
  the beginning of the line.

  If ARG is not nil or 1, move forward ARG - 1 lines first.  If
  point reaches the beginning or end of the buffer, stop there."
    (interactive "^p")
    (setq arg (or arg 1))

    ;; Move lines first
    (when (/= arg 1)
      (let ((line-move-visual nil))
        (forward-line (1- arg))))

    (let ((orig-point (point)))
      (back-to-indentation)
      (when (= orig-point (point))
        (move-beginning-of-line 1))))

  ;; remap C-a to `smarter-move-beginning-of-line'

** Mark

* Theme Configuration

** Custom Themes

I tend to like playing around with different color themes. Sometimes this

into their own directory.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (setq custom-theme-directory (concat user-emacs-directory "themes"))

** Fonts
I have moved to using the =Adobe Source Code Pro= font. More information
may be found on Source Code Pro can be found [[http://blog.typekit.com/2012/09/24/source-code-pro/][here]].

Two separate fonts are possible, one for normal use and the other for use
in presentation mode. Define some variables to hold them.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (defvar jme/default-font ""
    "Default font to use.")
  (defvar jme/presentation-font ""
    "Font to use for presentations.")
#+END_SRC

Set appropriate fonts for the platform.

*** Presentation and Default theme
